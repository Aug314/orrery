# orrery
Click in the text field in the lower left corner of the window. (If such text field is not visible, one might have to scroll down a bit.)
F : Toggle start/stop moving the orrery forward in time.
K : Zoom in.
Shift+K : Zoom out.
L : Toggle logarithmic view.
I : Paint the background indigo.
B : Paint the background black.
E : Paint the background (Erin) green.
G : Paint the background (golden flower) yellow.
C : Toggle showing the orbits of the planets. ("C" stands for "circles", but they are not really circles; they are ellipses.)
3 : Paint the orbits green.
5 : Paint the orbits red.
8 : Paint the orbits blue.
O : Toggle outer/close-up view of inner solar system (Mercury to Mars). If the zoom factor is sufficiently out then it zooms in to the inner planets. If the zoom factor is sufficiently in then it zooms out to the outer planets. If it is in between then this toggling can become disabled, but by zooming sufficiently in or out it can become re-enabled.
Shift+U : Rotate perspective "up".
Shift+D : Rotate perspective "down".
T : Toggle trace mode. (Trace mode requires the screen to be black, and it works better if the orbits are turned off (C key).)
V : Toggle "vibe mode" on/off. (Vibe mode to cycle the color of the orbits sinusoidally between white and their assigned color.)
U : Increase rate of the red/white orbit color cycling.
D : Decrease rate of the red/white orbit color cycling.


Besides showing the eight planets as well as Pluto, it also shows Ceres, Chiron, and Eris. Each planet (or dwarf planet or planetoid) is represented by a disk with a uniform color.
